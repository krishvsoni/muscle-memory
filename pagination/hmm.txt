Imagine you’re showing 10 posts per page.

Scenario:

100 posts exist.

You fetch page 2 (posts 11–20).

Someone inserts a new post at the top (ID 0).

Offset pagination:

If you use OFFSET 10, it now fetches posts 12–21 instead!
➡️ You skip one extra because the data shifted.

Cursor pagination:

If you use WHERE id > 10, you still get posts 11–20.
➡️ The data didn’t shift — consistent results.
